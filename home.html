        <p>The Institute has been making great efforts to face the challenges and opportunities presented by the current globalization scenario. The institute’s mission has always been to nurture the students into capable and innovative professionals who contribute to the growth of technology. The institute offers campus placements to students graduating with B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering). I am confident that our students will make a mark wherever they go and make their alma mater proud of them. I must thank the companies that have displayed a strong faith in our students during and beyond the placement process. Also we extend a special invitation to the new recruiters who are yet to catch a glimpse of our students and the institute for the upcoming placements.</p>
